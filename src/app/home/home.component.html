          Photos have the incredible ability to transport you to
           a place,tell a story and provide inspiration, simply by capturing one moment in time.</p>
          
           <p>
           Ever since the camera was invented in 1816, humans have been fascinated with the art of photography.
          </p>
  
          <p>
           Fast forward to today, and almost every single person on this planet has access to a camera,whether that is a professional DSLR,
            a point-and-shoot, or just their smartphone in their pocket.
            </p>
        
          <p>
            Storytelling through imagery is now part of our daily lives,
             whether thatâ€™s through photojournalism, entertainment, food, family, or in our case, travel.</p>
  
          
          <p>
             Our own love of travel photography started more than a decade ago,
             when we first started exploring the world and turning to books and magazines for inspiration on where to go next.</p>
  
           
          <p>
             As the years have passed by we shifted from being admirers of photography to becoming photographers ourselves.</p>
